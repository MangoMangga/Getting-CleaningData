Data Set Information

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
Attribute Information

For each record in the dataset it is provided:

    Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
    Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.
    Its activity label.

Process

The script run_analysis.R performs the following process to clean up the data and create tiny data sets:

    Merge the training and test sets to create one data set.

    Reads features.txt and uses only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

    Reads activity_labels.txt and applies human readable activity names to name the activities in the data set.

    Labels the data set with descriptive names. (Names are converted to lower case; underscores and brackets are removed.)

    Merges the features with activity labels and subject IDs. The result is saved as tidyData.txt.

    The average of each measurement for each activity and each subject is merged to a second data set. The result is saved as tidyData2.txt.
